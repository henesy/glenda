Problems
* Scripts should have a universal config such as an environment variable (more portable/configurable)
* No role/user restrictions (should be a txt file of admin/mod users, maybe)
* Reminders don't persist between bot reboots
* Reminders should be hashed and deletable/modifiable by the creating user
* Reminders should use a min heap
* Config is not modular and should allow config modules to be loaded and have .cfg files associated with them (such as for feeds and reminders)
